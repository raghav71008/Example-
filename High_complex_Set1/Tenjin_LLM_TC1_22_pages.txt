Abstract The objective of this article is to present paths  that can contribute to mitigating the effects of  climate change on houses built in the metropolis of  Curitiba. The analysis of the occurrence of natural  disasters in the state of Paraná demonstrates that  the most frequent extreme climatic event is the  windstorm, and the Curitiba region is the one that  most presented occurrences of windstorms in the  analyzed period. Federal laws and municipal plans  related to the theme are presented, as well as  points that can be adopted as tools to mitigate the  impacts of the climate crisis on the city. Finally, it  is concluded that, through the concept of demand- -side innovation policies with the use of software  programs, which simulate the future scenario of  climate transformations, it is possible to contribute  to the development of resilient housing.  

Introduction 

The objective of this article is to shed light on  practices that mitigate the impacts resulting  from climate change in housing, in order to  incorporate them in the approval processes  of architectural projects in the municipal  government of Curitiba. According to the Adaptation and  Mitigation Plan of Curitiba (PlanClima), the  city already has an average temperature of  1.2°C higher than in the 1960s. Therefore,  the occurrence of periods of intense rain  and prolonged drought is observed. “In both  cases, the population is impacted, sometimes  by disturbances resulting from flooding,  sometimes by water shortages or thermal  discomfort.” (PlanClima, 2020, p. 16). Regarding the scope of these impacts,  the less favored part of the population is the  most affected in terms of environmental and  socioeconomic issues, because it already  presents conditions of vulnerability, mainly  because a large part of this population lives in  precarious settlements and in risk areas. Solutions such as software development,  which help designers in decision-making, can  be a way to be adopted to mitigate the effects  of the climate crisis on living spaces in the city.  There are examples of computer programs  developed by universities, such as Analysis  Sol-Ar, from the Federal University of Santa  Catarina (UFSC), which help the designer to  analyze the incidence of predominant winds  and the annual temperatures of the city.  Another example is the Fluxovento program,  developed by students at the Pontifical Catholic  University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-RJ), which  simulates the air flow inside the building and  also results in information that can be used to  make decisions regarding the project. In order to meet with architectural  quality the social housing (SH), developed in  Curitiba by the Popular Housing Company of  Curitiba (Cohab-CT), and also the new Bidding  Law (law n. 14.133/2021), another possible  solution would be the application of the tender  modality in the development of projects. By  using specialized technical knowledge for this  purpose, such a practice would help to mitigate  the effects of climate change on housing built  by the municipal administration. After this first moment, the article brings,  in the second part, the presentation of the  concepts that identify the climate crisis, in  addition to a literature review about cities and  climate change in a third moment. The cities  analyzed are: Belo Horizonte, São Paulo, São  Francisco (United States) and Toronto (Canada),  in addition to Curitiba, which is analyzed in  more depth. In the fourth part, it discusses the  existing software developed by universities,  which guarantee its free use by any professional  responsible for the development of housing  projects, and how this solution would be linked  to the concept of Demand-Side Innovation  Policies (Dsips), which stimulate innovation  through investments in Research and Development (R&D) by the State. Finally, paths  are presented for possible practices to mitigate  the effects of climate change in new housing,  whether developed by housing policies or not,  and for them to be required in the approval of  architectural projects in Curitiba, thus resulting  in an urban built environment resilient to the  ongoing climate crisis


Regarding the methodology, according  to Gerhardt and Silveira (2009, p. 32), the  research has a qualitative approach, as it seeks  to understand the reason for the situations  analyzed and offer what can be done. It  presents itself as an applied nature, as it aims  to develop guidelines for practical application  in the approval of housing projects.  

Concepts about the climate  crisis and its effects  on the built environment 

Extreme weather or weather events, also  known as natural disasters, are classified  as occurrences that prevent the normal  functioning of a society's daily life (Fiocruz,  2022). In addition, such occurrences result in  material damage to the urban environment  and risk to the lives of residents. According to the Climate and Health  Observatory (ibid.), these events are classified  according to their origin, which can be: I – Hydrological, such as floods, overflows,  floods and landslides; II – Geological or geophysical, such as  erosion processes and landslides arising from  geological processes; III – Meteorological, such as lightning,  tropical and extratropical cyclones, tornadoes  and windstorms;  IV – Climatological, such as dry spells and  droughts, wildfires and forest fires, hail, frost  and cold and heat waves. Cities, more than ever, are subject to  suffering from the consequences of these  events (Espínola and Ribeiro, 2020), such as the existing buildings in the urban environment.  According to the United Nations - UN (2022),  in the publication of the World Cities Report  2022, 56% of the world's population lives in  cities, and the trend, for 2050, is that this index  rises to 68%. Therefore, just as the climate crisis  does not respect geographic boundaries, it  also affects all social classes, regardless of  where they are located. However, it affects  more intensely the socially and economically  vulnerable classes. According to Silva (2012), in the  metropolis of Curitiba, precarious settlements  rose from 571 settlements and 54,662  households at the end of the 1990s to 984  settlements and 98,444 households at the  end of the 2000s. Houses built on land located  in risk areas are the most vulnerable to all  classifications of weather events. Houses  built on land located in areas designated for  this purpose are less subject to hydrological  events (floods, overflows, floods, land plants)  and geological events (erosion processes  and landslides originating from geological  processes), as they are generally located in  central areas of cities or in areas where may  have already exists studies to the definition of  residential zoning. Regarding the damage caused by  weather events in buildings, it can be adopted,  for analysis, the events that affect the roofs of  buildings, such as heavy rain and hail, usually  accompanied by windstorms. According to the Brazilian Atlas of Natural  Disasters (Ceped-UFSC, 2013), windstorms are  the category of natural disasters that most  affect the state of Paraná. The period analyzed  by the Atlas was from 1991 to 2012   

The Beaufort Scale is an empirical  measure that classifies the intensity of winds  according to their speed and their effects  on the natural and built environment. It  presents the speed in meters per second  (m/s) and kilometers per hour (km/h).  According to Chart 1, it classifies the intensity The Beaufort Scale is an empirical  measure that classifies the intensity of winds  according to their speed and their effects  on the natural and built environment. It  presents the speed in meters per second  (m/s) and kilometers per hour (km/h).  According to Chart 1, it classifies the intensity According to Tominaga, Santoro and  Amaral (2009), from 75km/h, that is, winds  classified from degree 9 of the Beaufort Scale,  the material damage caused can be: I – deroofing and/or destruction of buildings; II – launching projectiles that can damage  building windows; III – falling trees, poles and high voltage  towers; IV – damage to crops Using the Analisys Sol-Ar software, a  figure was generated that brings information  about the prevailing winds for Curitiba,  classifying their intensity according to the  season of the year and the direction of the  winds. When analyzing Figure 2, it appears  that the prevailing winds come from the east  (E), mainly because it is a municipality close to  the sea. The average speed of the east wind  is 6 m/s in all seasons of the year, except in autumn, when the average speed drops to 3  m/s. According to the Beaufort Scale, winds of  6m/s are considered moderate. It is observed that winds from the  northwest (NW) directions also have an average  speed of 6m/s in winter, and winds from  the southeast (SE) direction have the same  average speed of 6m/s in spring and summer.  According to the Brazilian Atlas of Natural  Disasters (Ceped-UFSC, 2013), the month of  October, which season is spring, is the one that  presented the most occurrences of windstorms  in Paraná in the period from 1991 to 2012. By  crossing these data with the data in Figure 2, it  can be seen that the most intense winds occur  in spring. According to Fonseca and Ferentz  (2020), the Metropolitan Mesoregion of  Curitiba had the highest number of occurrences  of windstorms in Paraná between 2013 and  2017, a total of 154. Southwest region with 109  episodes in that period   

Climate crisis  and its effects on cities 

Climate change occurs without considering  the geographical limits of countries or  municipalities (Espínola and Ribeiro, 2020). At  the global level, countries have been promoting  events, such as the United Nations Conferences  on Climate Change (COPs), in which actions to  be adopted by all to mitigate the effects of the  climate crisis are discussed. During the COP 21 edition, 195 countries signed an international  commitment to, by 2030, keep the increase in  global temperature below 2°C, when compared  to pre-Industrial Revolution measurements. The future is still uncertain regarding the  effects of climate change on the planet, but the  involvement of different areas and dimensions  is the best way to arrive at a perspective on  this scenario. Therefore, in order to obtain  practical results in the effort to mitigate and  adapt housing, it is expected that government  actions will be applied at the federal, state and  municipal levels (ibid.). According to Espínola and Ribeiro (ibid.),  some of the impacts of climate change on cities  involve: I – growing use of electrical energy to run  heaters and air conditioners; II – lack of drinking water; III – drainage and transport systems affected  by increased frequency of storms; IV – rapid increase in average temperatures;  V – increase in vector-borne diseases. Bai et al. (2018) state that 75% of  greenhouse gases (GHG) are generated by  activities carried out in urban centers, and  among them is civil construction. Cities play an important role in the  process of global governance of climate  change, as local action is the starting point  for possible solutions. Espínola and Ribeiro  (2020) argue that municipal master plans are  instruments that can lead to a successful path  in the necessary adaptations due to climate  change In order to insert urban planning  strategies that help in the process of mitigating  the climate crisis in the built environment  and to support the use of master plans as  standardization devices, the following federal  laws related to climate change and urban  planning can be cited: I – Federal Law n. 12.187/2009, which  establishes the National Policy on Climate  Change; and II – Federal Law n. 12.608/2012, which  institutes the National Civil Defense and  Protection Policy (PNPDEC). Chart 2 deals with these two laws and  the items related to urban planning actions,  which can help in mitigating and adapting cities  to climate change. Regarding the socioeconomically less  favored portion of the population, the location  of housing in risk regions is an item often  mentioned in the National Policy for Protection  and Civil Defense. According to Chart 2,  to alleviate the situation and in order to  encourage the use of urbanized land, the Union  can even transfer resources to municipalities  that acquire land in areas equipped with  infrastructure, with the purpose of housing use  for social housing  

Examples of municipalities  that introduce laws to combat  the effects of climate change 
 
 This part of the article mentions some cities  that have a type of planning aimed at mitigating  the effects of climate change. Belo Horizonte established, in 2006, the  Municipal Committee on Climate Change and  Eco-Efficiency (CMMCE), whose objective is T h e a g e n c y i s c o m p o s e d b y  representatives of the municipal and state  public authorities, in addition to members of  civil society, in order to ensure democratic  decision-making. In addition, the Committee  has partnerships with national and international  entities that aim to face climate change. Among  these partnerships, the UN agency Habitat and  the non-governmental organization (NGO)  WWF-Brasil can be mentioned. In 2020, the Climate Action Plan of the  Municipality of São Paulo (PlanClima SP) was  instituted in the city. According to Marimon  (2018), in 2009, the city was a pioneer in this  regard, when it launched the Climate Change Policy in the City of São Paulo (law n. 14,933),  which aimed to prepare inventories with  measurements of Greenhouse Gases (GEEs)  released by activities that take place in the city  every 5 years (PlanClima SP, 2020 PlanClima SP aims to include climate  change in decision-making by the municipal  government, in addition to making the  population aware of the impacts of the  transformations to come. It is an extensive document that covers the municipal actions  that existed before the Plan and that deals with  all the themes that happen in the daily life of  an urban center. Regarding housing, the main  focus is to increase the supply of social housing,  in order to relocate populations located in  areas at risk of landslides and flooding. Although several extremely important  topics are covered, in both plans analyzed,  no discussions were found about the quality  of housing – or even buildings in general –, in  relation to resilience characteristics regarding  the effects of climate change. However, it is  understood that Brazil has a housing deficit  of 5.876 million households (João Pinheiro  Foundation, 2021) and that it is necessary to  pay attention to this reality first. On the international scene, an example is  the city of San Francisco, in the United States,  which launched, in 2020, the Hazards and  Climate Resilience Plan (HCR). The municipality  is the fourth most populous in the state of  California and is located on the west coast of  the country. Among the risk of earthquakes,  extreme heat and drought, resulting from  climate change, are the most discussed points  in the plan. Comments from residents are  presented, who are concerned about the  quality of their homes, as they have doubts  whether they would be a refuge for days of  extreme heat or for poor air quality. The plan does not present measures to  adapt housing to withstand such problems, but  it takes the first step towards the search for  solutions, which is to identify weaknesses and  give voice to residents (City and County of San  Francisco, 2020) The city of Toronto, Canada, launched,  in 2019, the Climate Resilience Framework  (The Climate Resilience Framework). Even  in the case of a municipality whose average  temperature hardly exceeds 30°C, the concern  present in the document is also in relation to  the heating of the city Regarding the impacts of heat waves  on homes, there is greater concern with  the elderly population and with residents  whose homes do not have sufficient physical  characteristics to withstand extreme heat  

Actions for mitigation  and adaptation in Curitiba 

In 2015, the Master Plan of Curitiba underwent  a review process, which must occur every  10 years, according to law n. 10.257 of  the City Statute. In this review, one of the  concepts added was Preparing the City for  Climate Change, which involves issues such as  improving urban soil drainage and mitigating  the problems caused by heavy rainfall  (PlanClima, 2020) In 2009, decree no. 1.186 instituted  the Curitiba Forum on Climate Change, and  decree n. 572 updated the composition  of the Forum. In 2020, the Municipality of  Curitiba – in partnership with universities,  the Paraná Sanitation Company (Sanepar)  and the Paranaense Energy Company (Copel),  as well as other members of civil society –  launched the Mitigation and Adaptation Plan  to Climate Change (PlanClima). According to its  presentation, PlanClima aims to: PlanClima aims to guide public and  private sector actions so that the city of Curitiba  is aligned with the 17 Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs), launched by the United Nations  (UN) (Figure 3) The goal to be achieved is to reach zero  GHG emissions by 2050. However, as shown  in the conclusion of the document, even  considering optimistic scenarios, the forecast  is that this goal will not be achieved in its  entirety, which demonstrates the dimension  of the challenge and the need for urgent  multidisciplinary actions. According to PlanClima (2020, p. 45),  regarding GHG generators in the city of  Curitiba, residential buildings appear in 2nd  place, and commercial buildings in 4th place  in the list. In addition, the civil construction industry ranks 5th in activities that generate  the most GHGs, along with the manufacturing  industry (Figure 4). In order to organize PlanClima's areas of  action, five Strategic Sectors were established,  which classify the performance of public and  private actors: I – Environmental and Urban Quality; II – Energy Efficiency; III – Solid Waste and Effluents; IV – Urban and Sustainable Mobility; V – Urban Hypervisor and Innovation The sector linked to urban planning and  housing is the Energy Efficiency sector, which  mentions the objective of encouraging the use  of renewable energy and building efficiency. PlanClima also brings as a possible  solution the partnership of the municipal  government with educational entities, which  would strengthen the relationship with the  R&D (Research and Development) sector: To try to get close to zero GHG emissions,  PlanClima listed mitigation and adaptation  actions in several areas. In Chart 3, the actions  directly or indirectly linked to the areas of  urban planning and housing are described Thus, practical actions are necessary  so that the objectives of the actions listed by  PlanClima become applicable in the urban  environment. Thus, technological innovation  associated with actions by the municipal  government can represent this achievement  

Software and the concept  of demand-side innovation  policies (Dsip) as possible  solutions 

The objective of this stage is to present  the analytical framework of demmand side innovation policies, in addition to  demonstrating which instruments can help in  mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis on  housing in Curitiba, whether or not they are  developed by the public authorities In order to foster the process of  socioeconomic development, the Dsips help as  instruments that seek to offer improvements  through demands created by the State,  whether through public policies or government  purchases. According to Rauen (2017, p. 9),  “to the vast set of values already considered in  the most routine state actions (environmental  sustainability, social responsibility, etc.), it is  necessary to insert innovation”. Still according to Rauen, in developed  countries, the Dsips are in territories full of  opportunities in relation to technological  innovations, since the existing technologies have gone through a process of maturation  throughout their history. In peripheral  countries, such as Brazil, the “terrain” may  not present technologies that are so present,  mainly related to R&D, but this reality can  change “with the use of quality management  techniques, changes in layouts and the  introduction of new machinery” (ibid., p. 25). Macedo (2017) observes that most  innovation policies originate from the supply  side (supply-side innovation policies – SSIP). In  Brazil, SSIPs, linked not only to improvements  in science and technology infrastructure, but  also to tax incentives for this area, lines of  financing and economic subsidy, are not being  enough to “promote the innovation process”  in an intense way. In addition, demand-side  innovation policies would be complementary  to supply-side innovation policies, as shown in  Figure 5. Thus, the possibility of using software  can help design choices for any type of  housing. Chart 4 brings as an example four  computer programs developed by educational  institutions, which are free to use and can be  adopted as part of demand-side innovation  policies. The information generated by the  programs allows designers to predict mitigation  actions, such as building protections, or even  design strategies that avoid the intensification  of the effects of wind on these building facades.  Other software, such as Sketchup® and Revit®,  make it possible to study the project regarding  the solar incidence on the facades, which  helps designers to decide the ideal location  of windows, in order to heat or not a certain  ambience. Such actions could be applied in  master plans and municipal housing policies With regard to social housing (SH),  the Popular Housing Company of Curitiba  (Cohab-CT) is the agency responsible for  developing projects and executing works. In  order to promote SH projects that present  characteristics of mitigating the effects of the  climate crisis, a path already adopted by several  cities in Brazil and also by other countries is the  bidding modality by project competition. In 2018, CAU-PR (Council of Architecture  a n d Ur b a n i s m o f Pa ra n á ) a n d s o m e  architecture offices in Curitiba held the 1st  Seminar Architecture in Debate, with the  opening activity of the public hearing "Hosting  Architecture and Urbanism Contests for  Contracting Public Works Projects". At the  event, several entities and professionals in the  area highlighted the importance for society of  the development of this type of bidding for  public works in Curitiba and the Metropolitan  Region, especially for social housing. The need to include this type of bidding in public policies  was put on the agenda, which would allow  specialized professionals working in the region  to contribute to the portion of the population  that most needs it. In Brazil, the bidding law n. 8.666/1993  placed tenders as the main form of contracting  services related to specialized technical  projects, although normally this guideline was  not followed, mainly due to the fear of public  managers that their decisive role in the choice  of projects could be jeopardized. In 2021, the new Bidding Law n.  14,133/2021, which replaces the previous  law and whose content has been simplified  to facilitate bidding processes. However, in  this amendment, most references to the  contest modality were deleted. In Chart 5, a  comparison is made between the contents  related to project competitions between the  two versions of the law Sobreira, Ganem and Araújo (2014), after  studying the policies of design competitions  around the world, such as the guidelines of  the UIA – International Union of Architects,  the European Union and the Scandinavian  Countries, present a Proposal for Regulation of  Design Competitions in Brazil , which includes  items such as: I – use of what was foreseen in the Bidding  Law n. 8666/1993 for design competitions; II – mandatory for specified cases, but  flexible to the point of local adaptations by  public managers and due to cultural, political  and economic differences; III – holding public debates on the strengths  and weaknesses of this modality, based  on national examples and international  experiences; and IV – use of guidelines from international  regulations for the development of the basis of  this proposal. As previously mentioned, the challenge  for the municipality of Curitiba is to meet the  17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),  including zeroing GHG emissions by the year  2050. However, it was found in PlanClima (2020)  that this objective will not be achieved, which  demonstrates the challenges to be faced by  public authorities and civil society. Still according  to PlanClima (ibid.), multidisciplinary actions will  be necessary to get as close as possible to the  objectives mentioned in the document  

Possible paths for resilient  housing in Curitiba 

In order to adapt the housing buildings to be  developed in Curitiba, to face the effects of  the climate crisis, it is proposed here the use  of at least three strategies that allow a resilient  future for the built urban environment. Although Curitiba presented, in 2020, the  Plan for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate  Change, it is clear that the emphasis given by  it to the area of urban planning is in relation to  the use of renewable energies; and there are  few concerns about the physical characteristics  that housing must have to face the effects of  climate change. The requirement for the presentation  of studies that guarantee the resistance of  the building to the effects of climate change  could be added in the approval of projects for  new housing and renovations. As mentioned in  the plan: “[...] the search for energy efficiency  in buildings, both in new constructions and in  existing ones, through readjustment (retrofit)  of installations, equipment and construction  standards is one of PlanClima's emphases”  (PlanClima, 2020, p. 79). This first strategy would be in line with  Action 5 listed in PlanClima (establish and  regulate requirements for buildings adapted to  climate threats), mentioned in Chart 3. Thus, there would be proof of the designer's concern  to mitigate the effects of climate change in  relation to: I – material preservation; II – security; III – environmental comfort of housing. A second strategy could involve the use  of software developed by teaching institutions,  as shown in Chart 5, in partnership with the City  Hall of Curitiba. Such computer programs could  simulate possible future scenarios, influenced  by the effects of climate change, such as: I – extreme heat waves; II – windstorms; III – heavy rains; and IV – flooding. In these scenarios, the effects of these  events applied to housing could help in making  design decisions, from the choice of materials  to the shape of buildings. In order not to burden the project  approval process, the software could be  purchased by the Curitiba city hall and  made available for free download to civil  construction professionals (architects,  engineers and building technicians). Just as  the project approval process in Curitiba is done  online through the city hall website, through  municipal decree n. 799/2020 – Simplified  Project, access to the software could also be  available on this platform, which presents in a  simplified and complete way the information  describing the approval process. In this way, these products, which  would be software, would be classified in the  concept of innovation policies on the demand there would be proof of the designer's concern  to mitigate the effects of climate change in  relation to: I – material preservation; II – security; III – environmental comfort of housing. A second strategy could involve the use  of software developed by teaching institutions,  as shown in Chart 5, in partnership with the City  Hall of Curitiba.

In this way, these products, which  would be software, would be classified in the  concept of innovation policies on the demand side, as Macedo (2017, p. 2) brings us: “[...]  government purchases associated with  Research requirements, Development and  Innovation (RD&I); technological orders”. With regard to social housing, a  third strategy, specific to the field of public  policies, would be the adoption of the bidding  modality through project competitions. In  this way, there would be certainty of applying  concepts of mitigation and adaptation of  housing in relation to climate change, through  the specialized technical knowledge of  professionals in the area. Thus, by requiring studies to mitigate  the effects of climate change on housing, the  role of innovation policies on the demand  side would be carried out by the municipal  government, and the RD&I sector would  be acting in partnership, in an attempt to  build a future resilient for the city and its  residents 

Final considerations 

This article demonstrates that, even with  the concern to mitigate and adapt the urban  environment built to face the climate crisis,  the path to reach the destination is still being  traced. The joining of multidisciplinary forces,  which must start at the federal level, go  through the state level, and reach the municipal  field, is an urgent challenge for all countries.  When noticing that the main climatic disasters  that occur in the metropolis of Curitiba are windstorms, one realizes the importance of  buildings, mainly housing, being designed to  resist the effects of these episodes. The future is still uncertain in relation to  the real effects of the climate crisis, but signs  of critical scenarios are already showing. The  use of multiple resources, such as technological innovations through R&D, allied to federal,  state and municipal laws and decrees, as well  as the specialized knowledge of professionals,  such as architects, engineers and technicians,  can result in an urban environment whose  dwellings will serve as shelters. resilient to the  effects of climate change.
